Mini User Management System

A full-stack web application that manages user accounts with secure authentication and role-based access control. The system allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles, while administrators can manage users, control account status, and access protected admin functionalities.

This project was developed as part of a Backend Developer Intern Assessment to demonstrate real-world backend development skills including authentication flows, API security, and clean architecture.
